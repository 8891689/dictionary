# Dictionary Combination / Mock Private Key Generator

It is used to generate word combinations or simulate Bitcoin private keys (hexadecimal strings) based on the provided dictionary file. Its strength depends on your word document. Assuming that your document contains all the words or character sets in the world, it can generate any password in the world.

## Features

*   Reads a word list from a specified dictionary file.
*   Generates word combinations based on specified lengths (or a range of lengths).
*   Optionally removes spaces between words in the output.
*   Optionally selects words randomly from the dictionary for each output (while still iterating through combinations internally to determine the total number of outputs).
*   Optionally outputs simulated (**non-secure**) Bitcoin private key hexadecimal strings instead of word combinations.

## Compilation

Assuming your C source code file is named `generator.c`, you can compile it using GCC (or another C compiler):

```bash
gcc generator.c -march=native -O3 -o generator

or

gcc combination_dictionary.c -march=native -O3 -o cd

```

This will generate an executable file named generator.

# Usage
```
./generator -i <dictionary_path> -l <length_specifier> [-k] [-R] [-p]

or

./cd -q <prefix_file> -h <suffix_file> -R Enable random mode
```

# Options:

-i <dictionary_path>: (Required) Specifies the dictionary file containing the word list. The file should be plain text with one word per line.

-l <length_specifier>: (Required) Specifies the length (number of words) for the combinations to be generated.

Can be a single number, e.g., 12.

Can be a range, e.g., 3-5 (will generate combinations of length 3, 4, and 5).

-k: (Optional) Removes the separating spaces between words in the output.

-R: (Optional) Random read mode. For each output generated, selects words randomly from the dictionary instead of sequentially. Note: The program still iterates through the combination indices internally to determine when to stop.

-p: (Optional) Private key mode. Outputs 64-character hexadecimal strings simulating Bitcoin private keys instead of word combinations. Warning: This mode uses rand() for generation, which is not cryptographically secure. Do not use this for generating real private keys!
-q Prefix vocabulary

-h Suffix vocabulary

# Combining Character Sets for Advanced Use 

./generator -i my_dictionary.txt -l 3-5 | ./brainflayer -v -b hash160.blf -f hash160.bin -t priv -x -c uce > key.txt

./cd -q my_dictionary.txt -h my_dictionary.txt -R | ./brainflayer -v -b hash160.blf -f hash160.bin -t priv -x -c uce > key.txt

# Examples

Generate word combinations of length 12:
Assuming your dictionary file is bip39_words.txt.
```
./generator -i bip39_words.txt -l 12
```

Generate word combinations for lengths 3 through 5:
```
./generator -i my_dictionary.txt -l 3-5
```

Generate length 12 combinations without spaces:
```
./generator -i bip39_words.txt -l 12 -k
```


Generate length 4 combinations, selecting words randomly:
```
./generator -i my_dictionary.txt -l 4 -R
```

Generate mock Bitcoin private keys (hex), ignoring dictionary content (but dictionary and length are still needed for iteration):
Again, this is NOT secure!
```
./generator -i bip39_words.txt -l 1 -p
```



# Note: -l 1 here just makes the program iterate once; the output key is independent of dictionary/length.
# You can use a larger range for -l to generate more mock keys.

# Important Notes

Security Warning: The private keys generated with the -p option use the standard C library's rand() function, which is not a cryptographically secure random number generator. Absolutely do not use the hexadecimal strings generated by this tool for any real cryptocurrency wallets or security-related applications.

Performance: Generating all combinations (especially in the default non-random mode) can take a very long time and consume significant resources, particularly with large dictionaries and long combination lengths.

Dictionary File Format: Ensure the file specified with -i is a plain text file, contains only one word per line, and uses the line endings expected by your system (e.g., LF or CRLF).
